# Lab 4: Licensing

1. See bottom of document

2. As per the instructions, I read the [four criteria for Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). The four criteria are: (Note: text of the four freedoms was copied from the aforementioned webpage)
    * The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
    * The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). 
    * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
    * The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3)

3. It is important to specify a license for every project so it is clear what can and cannot be done with the licensed material.  By default, even if no license is present, all of the project materials fall under copyright of the author.

4. If a project does not have a license, all of the project materials are under copyright of the author.  If those materials are then taken and introduced into another project, the author(s) of the original project could invoke their rights as the copyright holder, and charge a fee for its use.

5. The article [Why the Web beat Gopher](http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain) argues in the "Failure to follow the open systems model" section that the Gopher project died because it wasn't open enough.  I agree with this argument.  Centralized systems where a single group controls the roadmap of the entire project are set up for failure because they evolve too slowly.  Systems like the internet where adherence to the standard is incentivized due to compatibility with others, but not strictly required, are likely to evolve faster, and in a direction in which the most users are interested.

6. Microsoft's [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) is licensed under the MIT license.  The MIT license is a permissive license which allows .NET to be used to create things with no restrictions on usage.  If a tool like .NET had a more restrictive license, it would diminish the number of users and possibly lead to the project failing.

7. A project idea and associated business model was developed.  The repository with required information can be found at [this link](https://github.com/williamjallen/OSS_Lab4_Project_With_Business_Model) as per the instructions.
